A [rate of convergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_of_convergence) can be calculated numerically but it is also often visualized on a loglog plot. The file `convergence.csv` contains the errors associated with a Forward Euler method, Trapezoidal method, and the spacial resolution used. Plot dx vs error for both runs on a loglog scale. Include a dashed line with the exact slope of $dx^1$ and $dx^2$ to help guide the eye. \n",
